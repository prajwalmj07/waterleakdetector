# waterleakdetector

This project mainly focuses on remote monitoring of the watersupply and leakdetection system.

When our flow sensors detect a leak, our Android application notifies the user. If the user doesn't respond to stop the water flow, the application automatically cuts off the water after a designated time.
Additionally, the application keeps a record of the total volume of water that has passed through the pipes.
